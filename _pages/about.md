Hi, welcome to my world. I am a Machine Learning Research Engineer specialized in Natural Language Processing. I also have some understandings in voice biometrics and embedding systems.

I am an Oregon State University and Hanoi-Amsterdam Highschool for the Gifted alumnus. I actually majored in Computer Engineering and minored in Computer Science, and many great people and opportunities inspired me to enter Machine Learning, to whom I am very grateful. Another fun fact about me is that I studied French for most of my 12 grades, and I have earned multiple awards in student competition in French.

I am also a part-time anime lover, gamer, guitarist, pianist, sometimes singer, tutor and translator.

## 2024
* February 24: I was invited to the Google Developer Students Clubs (GDSC) Hackathon Vietnam as a mentor to provide support for student teams. Their mission is to propose a feasible solution/product/technology to support the United Nations' [17 sustainable development goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals)

## 2023
* December 23: Our team released a open-source large language model ([vbd-llama2-7B-50b](https://huggingface.co/LR-AI-Labs/vbd-llama2-7B-50b-chat)) for Vietnamese in an effort to support the community. The model was continuously pretrained from Meta's Llama2 with vocab extension and language adaptation. Our model achieved significant results on multiple benchmarks and empirically supported our hypothesis of language adaptation for LLMs.
* December 23: Our department at VinBigData released a demo of a Vietnamese conversational system based on a LLM that was trained from scratch. This model is however closed-source, but we received many promising feedbacks from the community.
